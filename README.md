# Introduction to Flask

The slides and code were created for an Introduction to Flask class held
at i3Detroit (https://www.i3detroit.org/).

The code includes three Flask web applications:

## Hello World

This is a minimal Flask application contained in one file.

## Simple Example

This demonstrates Jinja2 templates, template inheritance, and passing a
Python object to a template.

## Team Accolade

This example includes a small SQLite database, a corresponding SQLAlchemy
database and more advanced templating.
